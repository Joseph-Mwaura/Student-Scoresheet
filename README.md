# Student-Scoresheet
Java application that collects full student performance data and generates a formatted report.
This project is a Java based console application designed to collect and process student performance data and generate a well–structured and formatted academic report.
The application simulates a basic school management system module that allows teachers to enter school details and students' examination scores for multiple subjects and then automatically computes results, including total marks, grades, and overall class statistics.
The main objective of the project is to allow users, typically teachers, to enter student records, and the system performs calculations to generate an accurate report that reflects individual performance and the class's overall academic standing.
The purpose of this project is to: provide a simple automated way to record and analyze student marks, eliminate manual grading errors through automated calculation, display a formatted performance report similar to what schools use officially, practice programming concepts learned in Java: arrays, loops, conditional statements, and formatted output.
